The false position algorithm works to find the root of a complex inputted function. The inputs of this algorithm include the lower and upper bound of the function, the maximum iterations, the number of arguments that are variables, and the equation function itself. These inputs are then utilized to find the root, the error, and the amount of iterations required in order to find the root of a complex equation. The iterations, roots, and error estimate are then displayed on screen.
