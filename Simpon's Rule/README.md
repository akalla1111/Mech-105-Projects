The Simpsons 1/3 rule algorithm works to integrate input data when the intervals are not even. In the scenario that the intervals are even of the inputted data, the trapezoidal rule would be utilized. The two arguments required for the algorithm include the x and y are arrays of a data set. The first step is to check if the matrix created by the data is square. If so, the code will continue and apply the Simpsons rule or a trapezoidal rule where deemed necessary. A new array will then be created which contains the integrated estimate utilizing the methods stated up top. This algorithm simplifies integration and significantly reduces the time it takes to integrate large data sets.
