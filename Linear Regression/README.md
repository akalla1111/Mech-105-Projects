The linear regression algorithm works to calculate the R squared value and equation for the line of best fit for the inputted data points. This algorithm utilizes the array data sets (2 array sets) that the user inputs in the command window. The algorithm then sorts this data to find the interquartile range. Any outliers are filtered out and the equation for the line of best fit is calculated. As an output, the slope, intercept, and R squared value is projected onto the screen. In order to use this equation one must provide the interface with arrays which can then be utilized to calculate components necessary to compute the linear regression line in MATLAB.
